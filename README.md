# Tic Tac Toe

This game of tic tac toe is composed of a Vue frontend and a Django backend that are completely separated.  The frontend and backend communicate via API.

The Vue frontend only displays the contents of the game board and makes API requests when the player or AI makes a move.  

The django backend handles API requests from the frontend and computes the AI opponent's next move.
